        <b>"</b> sizing in CSS sounds as though it should be easy. Until
        you try it. Many developers use the force; they tinker with the
        font-size property until it looks right only to find it’s different in
        another browser. A little understanding can go a long way…<b>"</b>

            <h2>The font-size Property</h2>
            <p>
              The <b>font-size</b> property can be set for any HTML tag (even if
              it would not normally contain textual content like <b>br</b>). It
              can be assigned a variety of absolute, relative, or length size
              parameters.
            </p>
            <p>
              An element will inherit the <b>font-size</b> of its parent unless
              you override it. This is especially important when you specify
              relative sizes.

              <h2>Absolute font sizing keywords</h2>
              <p>
                several absolute font-sizing keywords are available. the font
                size is determined from a browser preset and the element will
                not inherit its parent’s size.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li id="xx-small">font-size: xx-small;</li>
                <li id="x-small">font-size: x-small;</li>
                <li id="small">font-size: small;</li>
                <li id="medium">font-size: medium;</li>
                <li id="large">font-size: large;</li>
                <li id="x-large">font-size: x-large;</li>
                <li id="xx-large">font-size: xx-large;</li>
              </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="box2">
              <h2>Relative Font Sizing Keywords</h2>
              <p>
                Two relative font-sizing keywords are available. The font is
                sized according to its parent element:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li id="smaller">font-size: smaller;</li>
                <li id="larger">font-size: larger;</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                For example, if the parent has a font size of <b>‘medium’</b>, a
                value of <b>‘larger’</b> will set the element to <b>‘large’</b>.
                Other font units are normally altered by a factor of around 1.2
                but, again, there is no standard and browser results will
                differ.

              <h2>Absolute Lengths</h2>
              <p>The font-size property can be assigned an absolute length:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><b>mm</b>: millimeters, e.g. 10mm.</li>
                <li><b>cm</b>: centimeters, e.g. 1cm ( = 10mm)</li>
                <li><b>in</b>: inches, e.g. 0.39in ( ~= 10mm).</li>
                <li>
                  <b>pt</b>: point, where 1pt is generally assumed to be 1/72 inch e.g.
                  12pt
                </li>
                <li><b>pc</b>: pica, where 1pc is 12pt</li>
                <li><b>px</b>: pixel, e.g. 14px</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                In general, there are issues with all these measurement units.
                Millimeters, centimeters and inches are inaccurate for a
                screen-based medium. Points and picas are unreliable since
                systems can use different dpisettings. Pixel appears to be the
                most suitable, but it can lead to accessibility issues because
                the text cannot be resized in IE.

            <div class="box2">
              <h2>Relative Lengths</h2>
              <p>
                The font-size property can be assigned a unit that it relative
                to its parent’s font size:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b>em</b>: 1em is equivalent to the current font size, so 2em is
                  twice as large
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>%</b>: 100% is equivalent to the current font size, so 200% is
                  twice as large.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>ex</b>: 1ex is equivalent to the height of the letter <b>‘x’</b> in the
                  current font. Few developers use <b>‘ex’</b>, but it can be useful in
                  some situations where you need fine-grained font sizes, e.g.
                  1ex rather than 0.525em.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Percentage and <b>‘em’</b> sizes are equivalent, <b>e.g. 50% = 0.5em, 100%
                = 1em, 120% = 1.2em</b>, etc. Some browsers exhibit subtle
                differences but it’s rarely a major problem. If you want to save
                every byte, you could choose the shortest definition, i.e. 50%
                is shorter than 0.5em and 1em is shorter than 100%.

            <h2>Text Sizing and Page Zooming</h2>
            <p>
              This is where additional complexity creeps in. Most browsers allow
              the user to:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                increase or decrease the base text size <mark>(image dimensions are
                not changed)</mark>
              </li>
              <li>
                zoom the page in or out so all the text and graphics change
                accordingly or allow both text sizing and page zooming.
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              Just to complicate matters further, Internet Explorer does not
              allow text resizing on elements which have a font size defined in
              <b>pixels (px).</b>

            <h2>CSS Font Sizing Recommendations</h2>
            <p>
              The general consensus is that <b>‘em’</b> or <b>‘%’</b> is the best solution in
              most situations. Fonts can be finely scaled relative to each other
              and browser text sizing is supported. I would also recommend using
              a percentage font-size on the body tag; it results in better
              text-sizing in some older browsers.
            </p>

              There are a couple of other recommendations I would suggest when
              you’re developing a site:

            <ol>
              <li>

                your browsers before testing <mark>(it’s caught me out a few times!)</mark>
              </li>
              <li>
                try <mark>reasonable</mark> combinations of text sizing and page zooming in a
                variety of browsers to ensure the text remains readable.

              <p>
                Google Web Fonts (GWF) or Typekit are systems which allow the
                use of fonts hosted on their servers. GWF is free to use, does
                not require you to have an account, and has no limit on traffic
                or domains unlike Typekit. Typekit sets the cost of the service
                according to the number of domains in which the font is used, or
                the site’s monthly traffic. One of the most valued
                characteristics of GWF is the option to download a desktop
                version of the fonts for use in the project design phase.
