               <p>SEO stands for “search engine optimization.” In simple terms, SEO means the process of improving your
                  website to increase its visibility in Google, Microsoft Bing, and other search engines whenever people
                  search for:

                  <li>Information on topics in which you have deep expertise and/or experience.</li>
               </ul>
               <p>The better visibility your pages have in search results, the more likely you are to be found and clicked
                  on. Ultimately, the goal of search engine optimization is to help attract website visitors who will
                  become customers, clients or an audience that keeps coming back.

               <h2>How is SEO different from SEM and PPC?</h2>
               <p>SEM and PPC are two other common terms you will read about a lot here on Search Engine Land and hear
                  about in the larger <a href="https://searchengineland.com/guide/what-is-sem">search marketing</a>
                  community.
                  Read on to learn more about both of these terms and how they’re related to SEO.
               </p>
               <h4>SEO vs. SEM</h4>
               <p>SEM stands for search engine marketing – or, as it is more commonly known, search marketing. </p>
               <p>Search marketing is a type of digital marketing. It is an umbrella term for the combination of SEO and
                  PPC activities meant to drive traffic via organic search and paid search.</p>
               <p>Put simply, search marketing is the process of gaining traffic and visibility from search engines
                  through both paid and unpaid efforts.</p>
               <p>So how do SEO and SEM differ? Technically they aren’t different – SEO is simply one-half of SEM:</p>
               <ul class="accordion">
                  <li>SEO = driving organic traffic from search engines. </li>
                  <li>SEM = driving organic and paid traffic from search engines. </li>
               </ul>
               <p>Now, this is where things get a bit confusing. </p>
               <p>Today, many people use SEM interchangeably with PPC (which we’ll talk about in the next section). </p>
               <p>This idea seems to undercut SEO. However, <a
                     href="https://searchengineland.com/seo-is-marketing-387001">SEO is marketing</a>, just like PPC is
                  marketing</p>
               <p>Here’s the best way to think about SEO and SEM:</p>
               <p>Imagine SEM is a coin. SEO is one side of that coin. PPC is on the flip side.</p>

               <div class="box1">
                  <h4>SEO vs. PPC</h4>
                  <p><a href="https://searchengineland.com/guide/what-is-paid-search">PPC</a> stands for pay-per-click – a
                     type of digital marketing where advertisers are charged whenever one of their ads gets clicked on.</p>
                  <p>Basically, advertisers bid on specific keywords or phrases that they want their ads to appear for in
                     the search engine results. When a user searches for one of those keywords or phrases, the advertiser’s
                     ad will appear among the top results. </p>
                  <p>So again, if we think of search marketing as a coin, SEO and PPC are two sides of the same coin – SEO
                     is the unpaid side, PPC is the paid side. </p>
                  <p>Another key point: it’s important never to think of it as “SEO vs. PPC” (i.e., which one is better)
                     because these are complementary channels. It’s not an either-or question – always choose both (as long
                     as your budget allows it).</p>
                  <p>As we mentioned before, the terms SEM and PPC are used within the industry interchangeably. However,
                     that isn’t the case here on Search Engine Land. </p>
                  <p>Whenever we mention “SEM,” it will be because we’re referring to both SEO (organic search) and PPC
                     (paid search). </p>

                     <h4>If you’re curious about the history behind how “SEM” came to mean “PPC” at the exclusion of SEO, you

               <h2>Why is SEO important?</h2>
               <p>SEO is a critical marketing channel. First, and foremost: <a
                     href="https://searchengineland.com/organic-search-responsible-for-53-of-all-site-traffic-paid-15-study-322298">organic
                     search delivers 53% of all website traffic</a>.</p>
               <p>That’s one big reason why the global SEO industry is <a
                     href="https://www.researchandmarkets.com/reports/5623609/seo-market-size-share-trends-by-component-by">forecast</a>
                  to reach a staggering $122.11 billion by
                  2028. SEO drives real business results for brands, businesses and organizations of all sizes.</p>
               <p>Whenever people want to go somewhere, do something, find information, research or buy a
                  product/service – their journey typically begins with a search. </p>
               <p>But today, <a
                     href="https://searchengineland.com/modern-search-landscape-how-where-reach-target-audience-388290">search
                     is incredibly fragmented</a>. Users may search on traditional web search engines (e.g.,
                  Google, Microsoft Bing), social platforms (e.g., YouTube, TikTok) or retailer websites (e.g., Amazon).
               </p>
               <p>In fact, 61% of U.S. online shoppers start their product search on Amazon, compared to 49% who start
                  on a search engine like Google. Also of note from that same <a
                     href="https://www.insiderintelligence.com/content/online-shoppers-search-on-amazon">research</a>:
               </p>
               <ul class="accordion">
                  <li>32% start on Walmart.com.</li>
                  <li>20% start on YouTube.</li>
                  <li>19% start on Facebook.</li>
                  <li>15% start on Instagram.</li>
                  <li>11% start on TikTok.</li>
               </ul>
               <p><a href="https://searchengineland.com/google-now-handles-2-999-trillion-searches-per-year-250247">Trillions
                     of searches</a> are conducted every year. Search is often the primary source of traffic for
                  websites, which makes it essential to be “search engine friendly” on any platform where people can
                  search for your brand or business. </p>
               <p>What this all means is that improving your visibility, and ranking higher in search results than your
                  competition, can positively impact your bottom line, </p>
               <p>SEO is also incredibly important because the search engine results pages (or SERPs) are super
                  competitive – filled with search features (and PPC ads). SERP features include:</p>
               <ul class="accordion">
                  <li>Knowledge panels.</li>
                  <li>Featured snippets.</li>
                  <li>Maps.</li>
                  <li>Images. </li>
                  <li>Videos.</li>
                  <li>Top stories (news).</li>
                  <li>People Also Ask.</li>
                  <li>Carousels.</li>
               </ul>
               <p>Another reason SEO is critical for brands and businesses: unlike other marketing channels, good SEO
                  work is sustainable. When a paid campaign ends, so does the traffic. Traffic from social media traffic
                  is at best unreliable – and a fraction of what it once was.</p>
               <p>SEO is the foundation of holistic marketing, where everything your company does matters. Once you
                  understand what your users want, you can then implement that knowledge across your:</p>
               <ul class="accordion">
                  <li>Campaigns (paid and organic).</li>
                  <li>Website content.</li>
                  <li>Social media properties.</li>
               </ul>
               <p>SEO is a channel that drives the traffic you need to achieve key business goals (e.g., conversions,
                  visits, sales). It also builds trust – a website that ranks well is generally regarded as
                  authoritative or trustworthy, which are key elements Google wants to reward with better rankings.</p>

               <h2>Types of SEO</h2>
               <p>There are three types of SEO:</p>
               <ul class="accordion">
                  <li><b>Technical SEO:</b> Optimizing the technical aspects of a website</li>
                  <li><b>On-site SEO:</b> Optimizing the content on a website for users and search engines.</li>
                  <li><b>Off-site SEO:</b> <a
                        href="https://searchengineland.com/brand-marketing-improve-eat-signals-389390">Creating brand
                        assets</a> (e.g., ​​people, marks, values, vision, slogans,
                     catchphrases, colors) and doing things that will ultimately enhance brand awareness and recognition
                     (i.e., demonstrating and growing its expertise, authority and trustworthiness) and demand
                     generation.</li>
               </ul>
               <p>You maintain 100% control over content and technical optimizations. That’s not always true with
                  off-site (you can’t control links from other sites or if platforms you rely on end up shutting down or
                  making a major change), but those activities are still a key part of this SEO trinity of success. </p>
               <p>Imagine SEO as a sports team. You need both a strong offense and defense to win – and you need fans
                  (a.k.a., an audience). Think of technical optimization as your defense, content optimization as your
                  offense, and off-site optimization as ways to attract, engage and retain a loyal fanbase.</p>
               <h4>Technical optimization</h4>
               <p>Trillions of searches are conducted every year. Search is often the primary source of traffic for
                  websites, which makes it essential to be “search engine friendly” on any platform where people can
                  search for your brand or business. </p>
               <p>Optimizing the technical elements of a website is crucial and fundamental for SEO success. </p>
               <p>It all starts with architecture – creating a website that can be crawled and indexed by search
                  engines. As Gary Illyes, Google’s trends analyst, once put it in a Reddit AMA: “MAKE THAT DAMN SITE
                  CRAWLABLE.” </p>
               <p>You want to make it easy for search engines to discover and access all of the content on your pages
                  (i.e., text, images, videos). What technical elements matter here: URL structure, navigation, internal
                  linking, and more.</p>
               <p>Experience is also a critical element of technical optimization. Search engines stress the importance
                  of pages that load quickly and provide a good user experience. Elements such as Core Web Vitals,
                  mobile-friendliness and usability, HTTPS, and avoiding intrusive interstitials all matter in technical
                  SEO. </p>
               <p>Another area of technical optimization is structured data (a.k.a., schema). Adding this code to your
                  website can help search engines better understand your content and enhance your appearance in the
                  search results. </p>
               <p>Plus, web hosting services, CMS (content management system) and site security all play a role in SEO.

               <h2>Content optimization</h2>
               <p>In SEO, your content needs to be optimized for two primary audiences: people and search engines. What
                  this means is that you optimize the content your audience will see (what’s actually on the page) as
                  well as what search engines will see (the code).</p>
               <p>The goal, always, is to publish helpful, <a
                     href="https://searchengineland.com/what-is-quality-content-251071">high-quality content</a>. You
                  can do this through a combination
                  of understanding your audience’s wants and needs, data and guidance provided by Google.</p>
               <h4>When optimizing content for people, you should make sure it:</h4>
               <ul class="accordion">
                  <li>Covers relevant topics with which you have experience or expertise.</li>
                  <li>Includes keywords people would use to find the content.</li>
                  <li>Is unique or original.</li>
                  <li>Is well-written and free of grammatical and spelling errors.</li>
                  <li>Is up to date, containing accurate information.</li>
                  <li>Includes multimedia (e.g., images, videos).</li>
                  <li>Is better than your SERP competitors.</li>
                  <li>Is readable – structured to make it easy for people to understand the information you’re sharing
                     (think: subheadings, paragraph length, use bolding/italics, ordered/unordered lists, reading level,
                     etc.).</li>
               </ul>
               <h4>For search engines, some key content elements to optimize for are:</h4>
               <ul class="accordion">
                  <li>Title tags</li>
                  <li>Meta description</li>

               <h2>Off-site optimization</h2>
               <p>There are several activities that may not be “SEO” in the strictest sense, but nonetheless can align
                  with and help contribute indirectly to SEO success.</p>
               <p>Link building (the process of acquiring links to a website) is the activity most associated with
                  off-site SEO. There can be great benefits (e.g., rankings, traffic) from getting a diverse number of
                  links pointing at your website from relevant, authoritative, trusted websites. Link quality beats link
                  quantity – and a large quantity of quality links is the goal.</p>
               <h4>And how do you get those links? There are a variety of website promotion methods that synergize with
                  SEO efforts. These include:</h4>
               <ul class="accordion">
                  <li>Covers relevant topics with which you have experience or expertise.</li>
                  <li>Includes keywords people would use to find the content.</li>
                  <li>Is unique or original.</li>
                  <li>Is well-written and free of grammatical and spelling errors.</li>
                  <li>Is up to date, containing accurate information.</li>
                  <li>Includes multimedia (e.g., images, videos).</li>
                  <li>Is better than your SERP competitors.</li>
                  <li>Is readable – structured to make it easy for people to understand the information you’re sharing
                     (think: subheadings, paragraph length, use bolding/italics, ordered/unordered lists, reading level,
                     etc.).</li>
               </ul>
               <h4>For search engines, some key content elements to optimize for are:</h4>
               <ul class="accordion">
                  <li>Title tags</li>
                  <li>Meta description</li>
                  <li>Header tags (H1-H6)</li>
                  <li>Image alt text</li>
                  <li>Open graph and Twitter Cards metadata</li>

               <h2>SEO specialties</h2>
               <p>Search engine optimization also has a few subgenres. Each of these specialty areas is different from
                  “regular SEO” in its own way, generally requiring additional tactics and presenting different
                  challenges.
               </p>
               <h4>Five such SEO specialties include:</h4>
               <ul class="accordion">
                  <li><b>Ecommerce SEO:</b> Additional SEO elements include optimizing category pages, product pages,
                     faceted navigation, internal linking structures, product images, product reviews, schema and more.
                  </li>
                  <li><b>Enterprise SEO:</b> This is SEO on a massive scale. Typically this means dealing with a website
                     (or multiple websites/brands) with 1 million+ pages – or it may be based on the size of the
                     organization (typically those making millions or billions in revenue per year). Doing enterprise
                     also typically means delays trying to get SEO changes implemented by the dev team, as well as the
                     involvement of multiple stakeholders.
                  </li>
                  <li><b>International SEO:</b> This is global SEO for international businesses – doing SEO for
                     multiregional or multilingual websites – and optimizing for international search engines such as
                     Baidu or Naver.
                  </li>
                  <li><b>Local SEO:</b> Here, the goal is to optimize websites for visibility in local organic search
                     engine results by managing and obtaining reviews and business listings, among others.
                  </li>
                  <li><b>News SEO:</b> With news, speed is of utmost importance – specifically making sure you get into
                     Google’s index as quickly as possible and appear in places such as Google Discover, Google’s Top
                     Stories and Google News. There’s a need to understand best practices for paywalls, section pages,
                     news-specific structured data, and more.
                  </li>

               <h2>How does SEO work?</h2>
               <p>If you found this page via Google search, you likely searched Google for [what is seo] or [seo].</p>
               <p>This guide is published on Search Engine Land, an authoritative website with great expertise on and
                  experience in the topic of SEO (we’ve been covering all SEO changes, big and small since 2006). </p>

               <h4>But let’s look at SEO more broadly. As a whole, SEO really works through a combination of:</h4>

                  <li><b>People: </b> The person or team responsible for doing or ensuring that the strategic, tactical
