               <h3>Dall (2024)</h3>
               <p>Dall (Hangul: 달, Moon; acronym for “Devine All Love & Live”) is the debut full-length album of ARTMS.
                  It was released on May 31, 2024, at 1PM KST, alongside the title track “Virtual Angel”.
                  It is the third LOONA album to include a pre-release track, and the first one to have several premiere
                  singles.

                  The physical album comes in four versions: A, B, and two platform album versions. Additionally, an
                  Object Music Album was released in compensation for no Objekts in the regular and platform albums.</p>

                  <p>“The Carol 3.0” (Hangul: 더 캐롤 3.0) is the first pre-debut digital single by South Korean girl group
                     ARTMS.
                     It was first released on December 1, 2023, alongside its only song “The Carol 3.0”. The English
                     version was later included on the single on December 12, 2023.

                  <h3>Pre1 : Birth (2024)</h3>
                  <p>
                     “Birth”, a pre-released song from ARTMS’s first full-length album. This song announces not a new
                     beginning for ARTMS, which includes HeeJin, HaSeul, Kim Lip, JinSoul, and Choerry, but the real
                     beginning. “Birth” sings of mixed emotions of love and separation in a gloomy setting. As the
                     emotions after the breakup become excessive and the insomnia overlaps, you may mistake the breakup
                     or even doubt whether you really dated him or not. “Birth”, which was selected as a pre-release
                     song through fans’ vote, expands ARTMS’s musical world through high-quality music. After
                     sequentially releasing Pre2 on April 11th, Pre3 on April 25th, and Pre4 on May 10th, ARTMS’s first
                     full-length album Dall containing a total of 11 tracks will be released on May 31st.

                  <h3>Pre2 : Flower Rhythm (2024)</h3>
                  <p>The second pre-release song “Flower Rhythm” from ARTMS’s first full-length album is a song based on
                     the title track “Algorithm” and intro “Kehwa (개화)” from HeeJin’s solo album.

                     It was completed as a hybrid dance song created by borrowing the rhythm of “Algorithm” and the
                     intro song “Kehwa (개화)”, which means blooming flowers. You can enjoy the refreshing voices of ARTMS
                     members in a fast-paced rhythm, raising expectations for the two pre-release songs and this album
                     to be released in the future.

                     After sequentially releasing Pre3 on April 25th, and Pre4 on May 10th, ARTMS’ first full-length
                     Dall album containing a total of 11 tracks is scheduled to be released on May 31st.

                  <h3>Pre3 : Candy Crush (2024)</h3>
                  <p>
                     “Candy Crush”, the third pre-release song from ARTMS’s first full-length album Dall, is a song
                     based on HaSeul’s single “Plastic Candy”. The second pre-release “Flower Rhythm” was created by
                     borrowing HeeJin’s first solo songs “Kehwa (개화)” and “Algorithm”.

                     Although fans did not know, preparations for ARTMS’s album were being made step by step from the
                     time of HeeJin’s solo and HaSeul’s small theater concert. The planning of these pre-singles was
                     made in the sense that solo music will expand and join forces to create a complete picture called
                     ARTMS. The city pop genre’s “Plastic Candy” was refined into a more ARTMS style and the members’
                     voices were combined to create a richer song.

                     ARTMS plans to release Pre4: Air on May 10th and then release ARTMS’s first full-length album Dall,
                     which contains a total of 11 tracks, on May 31st.

                  <h3>Pre4 : Air (2024)</h3>
                  <p>
                     The fourth pre-release song “Air” from ARTMS’s first full-length album Dall is a song created by
                     sampling ODD EYE CIRCLE’s title song “Air Force One”.

                     Just as the second pre-release song “Flower Rhythm” and the third pre-release song “Candy Crush”
                     were created based on HeeJin and HaSeul’s solo music, respectively, ARTMS’s last pre-release song
                     “Air” was also made based on ODD EYE CIRCLE’s song, completing the puzzle in the series.

                     Through “Air”, which contains the unique sensibility of G-high, who has been producing since LOONA,
                     ARTMS’ music has a completely new charm compared to previous songs, raising expectations for the
                     upcoming album.

                     ARTMS’ album preparations began with ODD EYE CIRCLE’s Version Up album promotions, HeeJin’s solo,
                     and HaSeul’s small theater concert, and the culmination of ARTMS’s first full-length album Dall was
                     achieved by expanding individual music and joining forces.
