      <h2>History of the group</h2>
      <p>ARTMS (Hangul: 아르테미스; areutemiseu, pronounced in English as “Artemis”), also known as Artemis Strategy (Hangul:
         아르테미스 스트래티지; areutemiseu seuteuraetiji), is a South Korean girl group[1] formed by MODHAUS.

         While intended to be a project group and placeholder to house as many members of LOONA as possible once they
         made their departure from BlockBerryCreative, its final lineup is composed of 5 members: HeeJin, HaSeul, Kim
         Lip, JinSoul, and Choerry.

         They debuted May 31, 2024, with the studio album Dall featuring title track “Virtual Angel”.

      </p>
      <p>On March 17, 2023, HeeJin, Kim Lip, JinSoul, and Choerry were announced to have signed exclusive contracts with
         MODHAUS.[4]

         On March 28, MODHAUS filed a trademark request for 오드아이써클 (ODD EYE CIRCLE), and an additional request for “ODD
         EYE CIRCLE” (in English) on April 3, 2023.

         MODHAUS CEO Jaden Jeong said that since he left BlockBerryCreative in 2019, he and the LOONA members had kept
         in contact and had a meal together about once a year. Initially, the members came to Jeong for advice in
         picking a management company, but eventually decided to join MODHAUS. Jeong rejected speculation that members
         would join tripleS, instead referring to them as “sister groups” with possible cross-group collaborations in
         the future.[3]

         Jeong stated that the ARTMS members are currently creating new music, and he is “working closely” JinSoul to
         develop her A&R skills. Jeong also stated that he is “open” to revising the scrapped music of La Maison, with a
         “plan on releasing it at the right time”.[3]

         On June 20, HaSeul was announced to have signed an exclusive contract with MODHAUS, making her the fifth and
         final member from LOONA to join ARTMS.[5]</p>
      <div class="name">
         <h2>Name</h2>
         <p>The name ARTMS is derived from “Artemis”, the Greek goddess associated with the Moon. As such, it also
            shares connections with other things named after the goddess, including the Moon exploration program led by
            United States’ National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).

            Their Korean name “아르테미스” is officially shortened to “아르르” (ARR)</p>

         <h2>Concept</h2>
         <p>
            The group plans to “continue the identity of LOONA,”[3] following a similar moon–based name of ARTMS. The
            first project teaser shows twelve moons representing their original intention of reuniting LOONA as a whole,
            with four full moons representing HeeJin, Kim Lip, JinSoul, and Choerry. The catchphrase of ARTMS is “We
            rise together, back to the moon and beyond.”
